            <h1>The Problem</h1>
            <p>Rainforests cover less than 10% of the earth's land surface, 
                but they house approximately 50 million inhabitants and over 50% 
                of the planet's biodiversity. Although they are the most biodiverse 
                ecosystems, there is a limited knowledge of everything that lives in
                 these iconic environments. The value of the standing trees are not fully
                  understood and our ability to assess this value is restricted because the
                   rainforest environment is dense, vast, and complex.

            <p>We aim to enhance our understanding of the planet’s most diverse and 
                complex ecosystems by rapidly and remotely quantifying their intrinsic value
                 in unprecedented detail in a time that has never been more urgent for 
                 conservation. We use a fleet of drones and remote sensors to process a range of
                  data and reveal the true potential of the standing forest. We evaluate three types
                  of data.
